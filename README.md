# DoorCloser
This is a plugin for bukkit/spigot minecraft server. 

Close doors automatically after a player has opened them.
Also works for trapdoors and gates.
The number of seconds the door remains open is configurable.
You can limit the scope to specific mateials.
It also synchronizes double doors.

# Credits
Fou our role-play-server we have searched for a DoorCloser plugin and found 
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/auto-door-closer-and-opener-1-12-x-1-13-2.44093/
but this plugin seems no longer to be maintainanced (last supported mimecraft version is 1.13.2).
The original author (Psychlist1972) has released the sourcecode of his plugin on Github using an Apache 2.0 license.
Please see https://github.com/Psychlist1972/Minecraft-DoorCloser for reference.
So we decided to write our own plugin doing the same thing and reused some of his code for that.
